Windows Phone 8 Maps Control
=============

**Windows Phone 8 Maps Control** could be used for cases when there is a need to achieve more low-level control on the map rendering: this includes tiles downloading in particular. The architecture and design of the control allows easily _intercept tiles downloading process_ and use for instance _cached tiles_. Also it is by design easy to _integrate the map control with well-know map providers_ like google, opencycle, openstreet, bing and others.
